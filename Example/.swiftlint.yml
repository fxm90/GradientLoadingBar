opt_in_rules:
  - empty_count                # Prefer checking isEmpty over comparing count to zero.
  - force_unwrapping           # Force unwrapping should be avoided.
  - anyobject_protocol         # Prefer using AnyObject over class for class-only protocols.
  - empty_xctest_method        # Empty XCTest method should be avoided.
  - lower_acl_than_parent      # Ensure definitions have a lower access control level than their enclosing parent
  - overridden_super_call      # Some overridden methods should always call super
  - prohibited_super_call      # Some methods should not call super, e.g. `UIViewController.loadView()`
  - unused_import              # All imported modules should be required to make the file compile.
  - unused_declaration         # Declarations should be referenced at least once within all files linted.
  - explicit_init              # Explicitly calling .init() should be avoided.
  - closure_spacing            # Closure expressions should have a single space inside each brace.
  - private_outlet             # IBOutlets should be private to avoid leaking UIKit to higher layers.
  - operator_usage_whitespace  # Operators should be surrounded by a single whitespace when they are being used.
  - first_where                # Prefer using `.first(where:)` over `.filter { }.first` in collections.
  - object_literal             # Prefer object literals over image and color inits.
  - fatal_error_message        # A fatalError call should have a message.
  - missing_docs               # Declarations should be documented.
  - file_header                # Header comments should be consistent with project patterns.
