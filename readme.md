====================

![Swift5.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/Swift-5.0-green.svg?style=flat) [![CI Status](http://img.shields.io/travis/fxm90/GradientLoadingBar.svg?style=flat)](https://travis-ci.org/fxm90/GradientLoadingBar) ![Code Coverage](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/fxm90/GradientLoadingBar.svg?style=flat) ![Version](https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/v/GradientLoadingBar.svg?style=flat) ![License](https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/l/GradientLoadingBar.svg?style=flat) ![Platform](https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/p/GradientLoadingBar.svg?style=flat)

A customizable animated gradient loading bar. Inspired by [iOS 7 Progress Bar from Codepen](https://codepen.io/marcobiedermann/pen/LExXWW).

### Example
![Example][example]

To run the example project, clone the repo, and open the workspace from the Example directory.

### Requirements
- Swift 5.0
- Xcode 10.2+
- iOS 9.0+

### Integration
##### CocoaPods
[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. For usage and installation instructions, visit their website. To integrate GradientLoadingBar into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'GradientLoadingBar', '~> 2.0'
```

##### Carthage
[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks. To integrate GradientLoadingBar into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "fxm90/GradientLoadingBar" ~> 2.0
```
Run carthage update to build the framework and drag the built `GradientLoadingBar.framework`, as well as the dependency `LightweightObservable.framework`, into your Xcode project.


##### Swift Package Manager
The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler. It is in early development, but Gradient Loading Bar does support its use on supported platforms.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding Gradient Loading Bar as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/fxm90/GradientLoadingBar", from: "2.0.3")
]
```


### How to use
This framework provides three classes:

 - **GradientLoadingBar**: A controller, managing the visibility of the `GradientActivityIndicatorView` on the current key window.
- **NotchGradientLoadingBar**: A subclass of `GradientLoadingBar`, wrapping the `GradientActivityIndicatorView` around the notch of the iPhone.
 - **GradientActivityIndicatorView**: A `UIView` containing the gradient with the animation. It can be added as a subview to another view either inside the interface builder or programmatically. Both ways are shown inside the example application.

#### GradientLoadingBar
To get started, import the module `GradientLoadingBar` into your file and save an instance of `GradientLoadingBar()` on a property of your view-controller. To show the loading bar, simply call the `fadeIn(duration:completion)` method and after your async operations have finished call the  `fadeOut(duration:completion)` method.

```swift
class UserViewController: UIViewController {

    private let gradientLoadingBar = GradientLoadingBar()

    // ...

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        gradientLoadingBar.fadeIn()

        userService.loadUserData { [weak self] _ in
            // ...
            // Be sure to call this on the main thread!
            self?.gradientLoadingBar.fadeOut()
        }
    }
}
```

##### Configuration
You can overwrite the default configuration by calling the initializers with the optional parameters `height` and `isRelativeToSafeArea`:

```swift
let gradientLoadingBar = GradientLoadingBar(
    height: 4.0,
    isRelativeToSafeArea: true
)
```

###### – Parameter `height: CGFloat`
By setting this parameter you can set the height for the loading bar (defaults to `3.0`)

###### – Parameter `isRelativeToSafeArea: Bool`
With this parameter you can configure, whether the loading bar should be positioned relative to the safe area (defaults to `true`).

Example with `isRelativeToSafeArea` set to `true`.

Example with `isRelativeToSafeArea` set to `false`.

##### Note
There is a third option which will wrap the loading bar around the iPhone notch. See documentation of the class `NotchGradientLoadingBar` for further details.

##### Properties
###### – `gradientColors: [UIColor]`
This property adjusts the gradient colors shown on the loading bar.

###### – `progressAnimationDuration: TimeInterval`
This property adjusts the duration of the animation moving the gradient from left to right.

##### Methods
###### – `fadeIn(duration:completion)`
This method fades-in the loading bar. You can adjust the duration with corresponding parameter. Furthermore you can pass in a completion handler that gets called once the animation is finished.

###### – `fadeOut(duration:completion)`
This methods fades-out the loading bar.  You can adjust the duration with corresponding parameter. Furthermore you can pass in a completion handler that gets called once the animation is finished.

##### Custom shared instance (Singleton)
If you need the loading bar on multiple / different parts of your app, you can use the given static `shared` variable:

```swift
GradientLoadingBar.shared.fadeIn()

// Do e.g. server calls etc.

GradientLoadingBar.shared.fadeOut()
```

If you wish to customize the shared instance, you can add the following code e.g. to your app delegate `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method and overwrite the `shared` variable:

```swift
GradientLoadingBar.shared = GradientLoadingBar(height: 5.0)
```


#### NotchGradientLoadingBar
This subclass of the `GradientLoadingBar` will wrap the loading bar around the notch of the iPhone.

For iPhones without a safe area, the behaviour stays the same as mentioned in the above documentation of the `GradientLoadingBar`.

```swift
let notchGradientLoadingBar = NotchGradientLoadingBar(
    height: 3.0
)
```

#### GradientActivityIndicatorView
In case you don't want to add the loading bar onto the key-window, this framework provides the `GradientActivityIndicatorView`, which is a direct subclass of `UIView`. You can add the view to another view either inside the interface builder or programmatically.

E.g. View added as a subview to a `UINavigationBar`.

E.g. View added as a subview to a `UIButton`.
[![Example][advanced-example--thumbnail]][advanced-example]

##### Note
The progress-animation starts and stops according to the `isHidden` flag. Setting this flag to `false` will start the animation, setting this to `true` will stop the animation. Often you don't want to directly show / hide the view and instead smoothly fade it in or out. Therefore the view provides the methods `fadeIn(duration:completion)` and `fadeOut(duration:completion)`. Based on my [gist](https://gist.github.com/fxm90/723b5def31b46035cd92a641e3b184f6), these methods adjust the `alpha` value of the view and update the `isHidden` flag accordingly.

##### Properties
###### – `gradientColors: [UIColor]`
This property adjusts the gradient colors shown on the loading bar.

###### – `progressAnimationDuration: TimeInterval`
This property adjusts the duration of the animation moving the gradient from left to right.

*To see all these screenshots in a real app, please have a look at the **example application**. For further customization you can also subclass `GradientLoadingBar` and overwrite the method `setupConstraints()`.*


### Troubleshooting
#### Interface Builder Support
Unfortunatly the Interface Builder support is currently broken for Cocoapods frameworks. If you need Interface Builder support, add the following code to your Podfile and run `pod install` again. Afterwards you should be able to use the `GradientLoadingBar` inside the Interface Builder :)

```
  post_install do |installer|
    installer.pods_project.build_configurations.each do |config|
      next unless config.name == 'Debug'

      config.build_settings['LD_RUNPATH_SEARCH_PATHS'] = [
        '$(FRAMEWORK_SEARCH_PATHS)'
      ]
    end
  end
  ```
