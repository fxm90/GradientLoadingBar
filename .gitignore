# We recommend against adding the Pods directory to your .gitignore. However
# you should judge for yourself, the pros and cons are mentioned at:
# https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html#should-i-ignore-the-pods-directory-in-source-control
#
# Note: if you ignore the Pods directory, make sure to uncomment
# `pod install` in .travis.yml
#

# Include `Pods` in repo in order to make symlink `Pods.xcodeproj` work (used for Carthage support).
